## ü¶∫  ABOUT  ü¶∫
The **42 Piscine** is an intensive one-month program that exposes participants to the school's teaching methods, including peer-to-peer learning, group work, peer evaluation, and project-based learning. <br>
Participants dive headfirst into the work methods of 42 students for 26 days, engaging in intensive learning and dedicating a month to mastering programming skills. <br>

This repository contains code developed at **42 Piscine**, from **02/09/2024** to **26/09/2024**.

**Most** projects require 50 to be validated, exams require 25 (the last exam is a bit different).

## üèä‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüèä‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è In-depth (Tried to keep it mostly spoiler-free)

During the **42 Piscine** you have to find out everything on your own or ask your peers for help, imagine on the first day, everyone gets on their computers, and... <br>
Wait, how do we login? One person finds out, shares with the person next to it and so the sharing train began! <br>
<br>
On the exams, you sit, login in to the exam with the credentials provided in the screen (usual ones won't work), and...  <br>
Wait, how do i start the exam? (You have 15m~ to enter the exam or you have to leave with 0. It's common for people to not find out how to log in the 1¬∫ exam!) <br>
And guess what, the next day you'll ask someone how they entered the exam, and the sharing train continues! <br>
